## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project helped me practice pixel-perfect implementation, responsive design, and interactive UI features such as a lightbox gallery and cart functionality using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned to closely follow a style guide and static design images to achieve a professional result.

### Continued development

I plan to further improve accessibility, add keyboard navigation for the lightbox and cart, and explore more advanced state management for larger e-commerce projects.
